# Universal Incremental Learning: Mitigating Confusion from Inter- and Intra-task Distribution Randomness
A more general and realistic incremental learning scenario than exisiting ones, named Universal Incremental Learning (UIL), where the model neither knows which new classes or domains will increase across all tasks, nor the scale of the increments within each task.
